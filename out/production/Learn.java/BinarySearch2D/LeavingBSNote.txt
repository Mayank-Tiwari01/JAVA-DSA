hello Mayank from future, this is cringe but i think i had to do it??
leaving BS here, i mean not gonna practice questions of just this now, gotta get forward
i did not do hard questions and i also do not think i know BS very well.
i am leaving bs at 2D arrays, will come back to practice more questions probably
what to try doing yourself:
BS on a 2d array which does not have this prop where the last element of the previous row is smaller that the first
element of the next row. It is just sorted row and col wise. also try doing this with rows being of variable length.

also bs on a 2D array who's rows does not share any relation, it is just that rows are sorted
eg: {12,13,14,15,16}
{1,5,7,11};
gotcha?
