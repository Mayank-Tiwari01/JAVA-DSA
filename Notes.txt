* what I left for earlier:
Rabin karp Algorithm's implementation. (understood the logic)

* What I have to learn:
hashing, hash table, hash set. (Done learning HashMap ans HashSet)

learnt 2's compliment and what it does (but did not completely understand why it works?)

the modulo approache to finding the number which is appearing once out of other numbers which are appearing n number of times
when n is an odd number. (did not understand, q8 from the video.)

* what should I practice more:
2d array questions, binary search questions (especially those which require a modified binary search)
